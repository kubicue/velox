####Proposal for final project:

I will extend the application to meet the following requirements:
      
      1. Add authentication to application
      
      2. Add users accounts and roles [create new user, delete user, edit user]
      
      3. Add User profiles detail page.
      
      4. Add Two models [user, shipment,]
      
      5. Use bootstrap and custom css to style the application
      
      6. Add the following views [home, ship, track, sign up, sign in users etc.]
   
   
#### Extra Credit
If time permits and the previous requirements are met:

I will add the following extra requirement to the **velox  ** project.

      7. Add the logic view/controller [back end dashboard/admin for users]
       
      8. ADD the Geocoder API to determine the best shipping routes and integrate Google maps API and Forecast io two show the user history of the shipment and weather data through the shipment route.
